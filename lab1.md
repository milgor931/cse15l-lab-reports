# CSE 15L Lab 1

*A simple tutorial on how to connect to the remote server at UCSD (ieng6) through the course-specific student account.*

> Step 1: Log into course-specific student account on

Log into your account on the UCSD Educational Technology Services site using this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Lookup your account if you already reset your password. If you have never logged in before, reset your password following this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit).

Once you are in, you should see a section near the top of the page displaying additional accounts, including one that begins with "CS15lwi23". Make a note of this account username because you will use it to log in later. 

> Step 2: Set up and open a new window in Visual Studio Code

If you do not have Visual Studio Code, go to the main VSCode website using this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click the download button. Complete the proper installation steps for your operating system to get it properly installed.

If Visual Studio Code is installed, you can double click on the app icon to open up a new window or click on File>New Window. To open the terminal window, click on Terminal>New Terminal.

You should see a new terminal window open as displayed below.
