# Lab Report 4

* Competition tutorial to learn how to use commands faster *

1) ***Setup:** Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account*

If I had created a fork of the lab 4 repository before, I went to the fork "settings" tab, scrolled all the way down, and clicked on "Delete this repository". I had to type the name of the repo to successfully delete it to get everything ready for the competition.

2) ***Setup:** Fork the repository*

I went to the lab 4 repo on github using this [link](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) and clicked the "Fork" button to create a fork of the repository on my Github account.

3) Next it to start the stopwatch on a phone or laptop!

4) Log into ieng6

Since I had logged into ieng6 before and it was the last command I had run before accessing the remote server, I pressed `<up><enter>` to save time and log into the remote server super fast since I had already set up the ssh key.

5) Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

I first clicked on the "Code" button in my fork on Github and used the "Copy" button to copy the "SSH" key. This works because I had already configured the ssh key on github before starting this project to make the process of using git to add, commit, and push changes to my Github fork super easy.

Since I am already connected to the remote server, I was able to write git clone and `<Right-Click>` to easily paste the SSH key I had copied from Github to create the repository.

6) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

7) Edit the code file to fix the failing test

8) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

9) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
